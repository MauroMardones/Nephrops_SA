# **Nephrops Stock Assessment and Exploratory Data Analysis (ICES Division 9A)**

This repository contains the full workflow, data structures, and analytical tools used for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and stock assessment of *Nephrops norvegicus* in ICES Division 9A.
The project integrates fishery-dependent and fishery-independent information, implements standardized data cleaning and processing routines, and provides reproducible scripts for visualization, spatial analysis, and model evaluation.

The structure and methods are designed to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and alignment with modern assessment frameworks used in ICES working groups.

## **Objectives**

This repository supports three primary objectives:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Examine long-term trends in fishery-dependent and fishery-independent indices.
   * Evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance, catch, and effort.
   * Identify data quality issues prior to assessment.


2. **Stock Assessment Framework**

   * Prepare input files for assessment models (e.g., SS3, Bayesian or state-space models).
   * Evaluate model diagnostics and uncertainty.
   * Support decision-making through biologically meaningful indicators and visualizations.

## **Contents**

### **1. `code/`**

Contains R scripts for:

* Data import and cleaning, Scripts are written using the **tidyverse**, **sf**, **geosphere**, **marmap**, and related scientific libraries.
* Handling survey time series (ARSA, ISUNEPCA, and model-based estimates)
* Normalization and variance propagation
* Spatial analysis (VMS/grid-based maps)
* Visualization of trends, uncertainty ribbons, and model outputs
* Assessment preparation and diagnostics in `SA_Neprhops_2025.Rmd` code



### **2. `data/`**

Includes:

* Raw survey indices (ARSA, ISUNEPCA, model-based estimates)
* Fishery-dependent data (landings, effort, size structure) (*not yet*)
* Intermediate processed datasets

Raw data remain unmodified; derived datasets are created programmatically.

### **3. `figs/`**

Stores output figures generated by the scripts:

* Time-series trends
* Standardized/normalized indices
* Uncertainty ribbons
* Spatial distribution of effort and catch
* Stock assessment model diagnostics

Figures are organized logically for reporting and publications.

### **4. `bib/`**

Bibliographic files for:

* Scientific references cited in reports and supplementary materials
* Citation styles (e.g., APA CSL) for reproducible documentation in R Markdown or bookdown
* cover format (`.sty`)

## **How to Use This Repository**

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MauroMardones/Nephrops_SA
   ```
2. Open the project in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Run scripts in `code/` in the recommended order (see documentation inside each script).
4. Generated outputs will appear automatically in `figs/` and processed data will be stored in appropriate subfolders.
